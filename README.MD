<h1 align="center">URLink: A URL Shortening service üîó</h1>

## üìö | Introduction

- URLink is a distributed and highly available URL Shortening service, built on the MERN stack.
- It uses Redis as a cache, and MongoDB as a NoSQL database.
- It uses Nginx that acts as a load balancer, and a reverse proxy for the backend server.
- It uses Apache ZooKeeper to provide tokens for hash generation, and eliminates race conditions between nodes.
- The entire application is containerized by Docker.

<br/>

## üöÄ | Usage

- Install Docker Desktop and enable Kubernetes for a quick setup.
- Clone this repository:<br>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shivansh9848/ShortURL.git
```

- Create a .env file with the following variables:

```js
REACT_APP_MONGODB_URI = "<enter your MongoDB URI>";
REACT_APP_REDIS_PORT = 1111;
REACT_APP_REDIS_HOST = "redis-server";
```

- Open the project folder and start the container with docker compose:<br>

```yml
docker compose up --build

Example: docker compose up --build --scale node-server=3
```

- Enjoy the project! üòâ
